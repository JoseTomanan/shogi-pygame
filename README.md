# Shogimon

This game is a Pokemon-esque implementation of Shogi, done using Python library Pygame.

This project was created with my classmate [SkIym](https://github.com/SkIym) in compliance for a course requirement in **CS 150: Programming Languages**.

## How to play (networking version)

To get started, first run the project server using the following command:
```
go run project-server/main.go
```

Then, run two instances of the Pygame client as follows:
```
poetry run python src/main.py
```

## Pass-and-play version

Alternatively, the pass-and-play version of this game can also be opened through the following command:
```
poetry run python src/main_offline.py
```

The game can be restarted by clicking `R`.
